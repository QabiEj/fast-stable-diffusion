### Google Colab

You can run this project in Google Colab for a cloud-based environment. Follow the steps below:

1. Click the "Open in Colab" button to open the Colab notebook.

    [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ShabanEjupi/fast-stable-diffusion/blob/main/fast-DreamBooth.ipynb)

2. In the Colab notebook, navigate to the section where you can clone this GitHub repository.

    ```python
    !git clone https://github.com/ShabanEjupi/fast-stable-diffusion.git
    ```

3. Paste the link above into a new code cell and run it. This will clone the GitHub repository into your Colab environment.

4. You can now work with the project directly in Google Colab, exploring the provided notebooks and executing code cells.

Feel free to explore the codebase, contribute, and use the Fast Stable Diffusion algorithm in your projects.
